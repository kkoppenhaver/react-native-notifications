# React Native Notifications
An example application that sends notifications to a React Native app
=======

This repo contains two pieces of an example: a Node application that can trigger a notification to a specific user as well as a React Native application that can be installed to receive these notifications. It is meant to serve as a proof of concept for how to deliver notifications via React Native.
